# Data_mining_and_discovery
Assignment given by professor John Evans


You will be expected to utilise your knowledge of creating SQL databases.

Picking any topic of your choice, you will generate a database using the SQLite software.

The database will contain at least 7 columns, where at least one column has nominal data, at least one has ordinal data, at least one has interval data and at least one has ratio data. At least one table should have 1000 rows or more. Extra marks will be awarded for the utilisation of foreign and compound keys across multiple tables. Randomised data covering all appropriate data types will be further rewarded. The more realistic a database, the better.

You will submit a PDF report (no page limit, but keep it succinct and to the point) with screenshots/pasted code about:

1.How you generated the data (do not download other people's data).
2.The schema of your database (graphical or textual is fine).
3.Your justification for any separate tables (including any constraints on any attributes) and an ethical/data privacy discussion.
